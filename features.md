## Research Interests
- power system optimization
- high-fidelity battery simulation
- cyber-physical security and privacy protection

## Power System Optimization
-Convex optimization: `convex hull relaxation`, `disjunctive programming`, `mixed-integer programming`
-Decentralized computation: `Benders decomposition`, `ADMM`, `Lagrangian relaxation`
-Differentially private optimization: `Gaussian mechanism`, `Laplace mechanism`
-Data-driven optimization: `DBSCAN`, `SVM`, `k-means`

## High-fidelity COMSOL Simulation
I have partipated in many COMSOL simulation applications, e.g., Degraded Underground XLPE Cable, Electrochemical-Thermal Coupled Modeling, Arc Simulation of Electric Circuit Breaker, and Life Cycle Prediction for Underground Cables.
### Degraded Underground Cable
Mimic the Water Tree Growth in Medium Voltage Underground Cable to Assess Cable Condition and Predict Remaining Useful Life (CAIRS in Hong Kong)



### Electrochemical-thermal coupled Battery
App.1 – Electrochemical-Thermal Coupled Modeling



App.2 – Blade Lithium-Ion Battery for BYD Company 


## Cyber-Physical Security and Privacy Protection
My research focuses on observability defense for active distribution systems and differential privacy protection.
