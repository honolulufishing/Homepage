## Research Framework and Interests
I specialize in Advanced Optimization for Power System Flexibility, Cyber-Physical System Security and Privacy Protection towards the affordable, reliable and sustainable goal for the clean energy future. My research vision is to adopt a holistic approach to enhancing the operational flexibility of high-renewable power systems, which involves achieving an optimal dispatch solution at the system level, ensuring feasibility at the device level, and strengthening cyber-physical and privacy security at the information level. Here are my research interests for Power System Flexibility:

- System Level: Power System Optimization
- Device Level: High-Fidelity COMSOL Simulation-enabled Grid-Edge Optimization
- Information Level: Cyber-Physical System Security and Privacy Protection

## <code style="color : blue">System Level: Power System Optimization</code>
- Convex optimization: `convex hull relaxation`, `disjunctive programming`, `mixed-integer programming`
- Decentralized computation: `Benders decomposition`, `ADMM`, `Lagrangian relaxation`
- Data-driven optimization: `DBSCAN`, `SVM`, `k-means`
- Neural Networks: `Neural ODE`, `Input Convex Neural Network`, `Fully Monotonic Neural Networks`, `Lipschitz Neural Networks`, `Multi-layer perceptron`, etc.
