##  Hi There, Welcome!
I am currently a postdoctoral fellow supervised by Prof. <a href='https://ece.ubc.ca/y-christine-chen/' target="_blank"> Y. Christine Chen </a> at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) from <a href='https://www.ubc.ca/' target="_blank"> The University of British Columbia</a> (UBC). My research focus centers around power system optimization and AI, high-fidelity battery simulation, and cyber-physical system security and privacy protection. Previously, I received the PhD degree at the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering (EEE) from <a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/' target="_blank"> The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a> (PolyU), where I was very fortunately advised by Prof. <a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eee/people/academic-staff-and-teaching-staff/dr-bu-siqi/' target="_blank"> Siqi Bu </a>, Prof. <a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eee/people/academic-staff-and-teaching-staff/prof-chung-chi-yung/' target="_blank"> C. Y. Chung</a> and Prof. <a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eee/people/academic-staff-and-teaching-staff/prof-chung-chin-shin-edward/' target="_blank"> Chin-shin Edward Chung</a> together. During PhD study, I was a visiting student at <a href='https://nus.edu.sg/' target="_blank"> National University of Singapore</a> (NUS) under the supervision of Prof. <a href='https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/gems/profhome.html' target="_blank"> Dipti Srinivasan</a>. And I used to be an experienced transmission/distribution system operator at State Grid of China. I am the first-generation holding the PhD degree in my family history, and my research motivation goes towards the affordable, reliable and sustainable goal for the clean energy future. Up to now, I have published more than 20 papers at the top transaction journals and international conferences, authored one book by China Electric Power Press and co-authored two book chapters by Springer, and granted 4 patents from China and Hong Kong.
